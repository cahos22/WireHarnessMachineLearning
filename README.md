# WireHarness MachineLearning
Machine learning analytics on Wire Harness machine data.

A cable harness, also known as a wire harness, cable assembly, wiring assembly, or wiring loom, is an assembly of electrical cables or wires which transmit signals or electrical power. The cables are bound together by straps, cable ties, cable lacing, sleeves, electrical tape, conduit, a weave of extruded string, or a combination thereof.
In this project, we are trying to do analysis on the dataset obtained from the machines. The data contains the occurance of error. The pandas dataframe was used to do the cleaning, and filtering the data needed for the machine learning.
Tableau was used for the data visualization. Several machine learning algorithms were used among them Linear regression, neural network, random forest.
